Copy-paste these into Google to check if 404s are indexed:
================================================================

1. Arabic blog posts with .ar suffix:
   site:deenup.app/ar/blog/top-10-islamic-practices.ar

2. Non-existent Arabic translations of SEObot posts:
   site:deenup.app/ar/blog/build-consistent-prayer-habits-busy-life
   site:deenup.app/ar/blog/common-questions-halal-food-answered
   site:deenup.app/ar/blog/struggling-fajr-solutions-work
   site:deenup.app/ar/blog/islamic-goal-tracking-apps-guide
   site:deenup.app/ar/blog/daily-islamic-habits-transform-faith

3. Tags pages (these now exist, so should be OK):
   site:deenup.app/tags/best-practices
   site:deenup.app/tags/deen
   site:deenup.app/tags/islam
   site:deenup.app/tags/quran

Expected results:
- ✅ "No results" = Not indexed (GOOD - nothing to fix)
- ❌ Shows results = Indexed (BAD - need to remove from Google)

Note: Tags pages NOW WORK after our fix, so they should be fine!
