✅ Image prompt generated: "I can do this — could you confirm the specific topic to represent, or should I proceed using "Test Article Title"? 

If you want me to proceed now, here’s a concise painting description using "Test Article Title":

A single, clear visual concept: a gilded open book set on a low desert stone at the canvas center, its illuminated pages unfurling into a flowing ribbon of water that transforms into interlaced geometric patterns and arabesque motifs. Olive branches frame the midground while dunes recede into a starlit azure sky; warm golden-hour light from the upper-left bathes the scene in rich golds, deep emeralds and burgundies, with soft cream highlights and visible, expressive brushstrokes and thick oil texture. Horizontal 16:9 layout with a gentle vignette at the edges, ample breathing space around the central book, and a quieter cream-toned upper third reserved for title text—no human figures, serene and contemplative."
