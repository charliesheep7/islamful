faqs:
  - question: 'How can I prepare for Ramadan this year?'
    answer: 'Start with realistic spiritual goals: set a daily time for Quran reading, plan manageable acts of charity, and gradually adjust your sleep and meal schedule a week before Ramadan. Consult local prayer and fasting timetables and ask a qualified scholar for rulings specific to your situation when in doubt.'
  - question: "What is the meaning of 'Eid Mubarak' and when should I say it?"
    answer: "Eid Mubarak means 'Blessed Eid' and is a common greeting exchanged on Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Say it to friends and family after the Eid prayer or when visiting people; it's a cultural expression of goodwill and not a ritual obligation."
  - question: 'When should I pay Zakat al-Fitr?'
    answer: 'Zakat al-Fitr should be paid before the Eid prayer, preferably in the last days of Ramadan so the needy can benefit on Eid day. If you’re unsure about calculation, consult a local scholar or reliable fiqh guidance for correct amounts.'
  - question: 'Is it permissible to fast on the day of Eid if I missed a Ramadan fast?'
    answer: "It is not permissible to fast on Eid al-Fitr; the Prophet ﷺ forbade fasting on the day of breaking the fast. Make up missed Ramadan fasts on other days after Ramadan (qada'), but avoid voluntary fasting on Eid day."
  - question: 'What does the Quran say about fasting and who must fast?'
    answer: 'The Quran commands fasting in clear terms, making it obligatory for adult, sane Muslims who are not traveling or excused by valid reasons (Quran 2:183–185). For personal cases like illness or travel, consult a qualified scholar for the correct ruling.'
  - question: 'Can I perform the Eid prayer at home if my local mosque is closed?'
    answer: 'Scholars differ on praying Eid at home; many allow it in exceptional circumstances (illness, safety, or public emergency) but recommend attending the congregation when safe and possible. Check guidance from trusted scholars in your area for the preferred practice.'

Ramadan 2026 will be a month many of us prepare for months in advance. In short: [Ramadan](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ramadan) begins when the new moon is sighted and ends after the sighting of the next new moon — the fasts are obligatory for eligible adults, and the last ten nights are the most spiritually significant. This guide gives clear dates and calendars (how to find them), the practical rules of fasting, daily spiritual habits and duas, and what to do during the last ten nights leading to Eid.

- Quick answers up front:
  - When does Ramadan end? It ends with the sighting of Shawwal's new moon — communities announce the last day locally.
  - What is the first night of Ramadan? The night before Fajr on day one, after the new moon sighting starts the month.
  - How to find fasting times? Use a reliable local prayer timetable or reputable online calendars for precise Fajr and Maghrib times.
- What you will get in this guide: clear dates and moon guidance, concise rules for fasting, practical daily routines and duas, and a plan for the last ten nights and Eid.

## Ramadan 2026 dates, moon sighting, and the end of Ramadan

- How Ramadan dates are determined: Islamic months are traditionally determined by the sighting of the new moon (hilal). Many countries use local moon sighting while others adopt global calculations. Expect official announcements from national religious authorities when the new moon is visible.
- When is Ramadan over / last day of Ramadan: Ramadan ends when Shawwal’s new moon is declared sighted. That date varies by country; check local announcements on the final nights. For a Quranic reference about Ramadan, see the specific verse on fasting and the month at [Quran 2:185](https://quran.com/2/185).
- Practical steps to follow the calendar:
  - Use your local mosque or official religious council for the final announcement.
  - If you rely on calculations, follow a trusted astronomical timetable that your community accepts.
  - If in doubt about which community to follow, consult a qualified local scholar.

External resources on moon sighting and dates:

- For the Quranic rulings related to the month and fasting, see [Quran 2:183–185](https://quran.com/2/183).

## Core Ramadan rules: who must fast, exceptions, and common scenarios

- Who must fast: Every adult, sane Muslim who is resident (not traveling), and not excused by clear reasons must fast. This is established by the Quran and Sunnah (see Quran 2:183).
- Valid excuses to not fast (examples):
  - Illness or a chronic condition where fasting causes harm.
  - Traveling with hardship.
  - Pregnancy or breastfeeding that endangers mother or child.
  - Menstruation and postnatal bleeding.
- Missed fasts (qada) and compensation (fidyah):
  - Make up missed fasts as soon as you are able (qada). For prolonged inability due to chronic illness, consult a scholar about fidyah (feeding the poor) as per juristic opinions.
- Practical everyday rulings:
  - If unsure about fasting due to medication, ask a qualified scholar and consult a healthcare professional (this is not medical advice).
  - If you eat or drink by mistake, the fast continues — the Prophet ﷺ said if one forgets while fasting and eats, the fast remains valid (see related hadiths compiled in hadith collections).
- For hadith guidance about the Prophet’s teachings related to fasting and days, refer to authoritative hadith collections such as those available at [Sunnah Hadith references](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1905).

## Ramadan daily routine: prayer, Quran, duas, and practical habits

- Daily spiritual routine (simple, repeatable):
  - Before Fajr: make sincere intention (niyyah) and recite a short dua; perform Fajr, then read a small portion of the Quran.
  - Midday: check in on family needs, give quick charity, and make dhikr.
  - After Asr: prepare iftar, make dua for those who are ill or struggling.
  - After Isha/Taraweeh: continue Quran reading and review what you read earlier.
- How to structure Quran reading:
  - Aim for consistency: even 10–15 minutes daily is more sustainable than an unsustainable burst.
  - Use contextual insights (not interpretation) to understand verses—seek knowledge from trusted sources and scholars.
- Practical duas to memorize and use (examples widely taught in the Sunnah and scholarly tradition):
  - Dua for breaking fast: The Prophet ﷺ used to say words of gratitude when breaking fast; many communities teach a short dua at iftar.
  - Night duas: Make personal repentance (tawbah) and ask for guidance during the last ten nights.

## Ramadan fasting times and sample daily timetable

- Where to find accurate fasting times:
  - Local mosque timetables — they use coordinates, calculation methods, and community consensus.
  - Reputable online prayer time calculators that allow you to set your city and madhhab preferences for juristic methods.
- Sample daily timetable (hypothetical example — replace with your local times):
  | Event | Example Time (local) |
  |---|---:|
  | Suhoor end / Fajr begins | 04:30 |
  | Dhuhr begins | 12:15 |
  | Asr begins | 15:45 |
  | Maghrib / Iftar | 19:10 |
  | Isha / Taraweeh | 20:30 |
- Use your local prayer calendar for exact Ramadan fasting times. For guidance on timelines and prayer practice, see trusted fiqh explanations and local mosque schedules.

## The last ten nights: seeking Laylat al-Qadr and spiritual depth

- Why the last ten nights matter: The Prophet ﷺ described Laylat al-Qadr as better than a thousand months; many acts of worship in these nights yield multiplied reward (see Quran 97).
- How to approach the last ten nights practically:
  - Increase night prayer (qiyam), consistent Quran recitation, and dua specifically asking for forgiveness and guidance.
  - Revise your schedule to protect rest and avoid burnout. Even one sustained night of prayer and sincere dua is powerful.
  - Perform i’tikaf if you can — it's a prophetic practice for seclusion in worship during the final ten days.
- Practical checklist for the last ten nights:
  - Make a list of duas and persons you will pray for each night.
  - Plan smaller, focused acts: extra Qur’an sections, two extra raka’at in the night, and repeated repentance.
- For deeper study on Laylat al-Qadr etiquette and best practices, consult scholarly articles like those found on [The Maydan or scholarly institutes], and ask a trusted scholar for local practice guidance.

## Eid al-Fitr: signs, celebration, and the end of Ramadan holiday

- When Ramadan ends and Eid begins: once Shawwal's new moon is sighted, the day following the last fasting day is [Eid al-Fitr](https://pluralism.org/ramadan-and-eid-al-fitr). National announcements typically declare the Eid day.
- What is Eid Mubarak meaning: "Eid Mubarak" means "Blessed Eid" — a greeting of goodwill, not a ritual phrase; it's widely used in many cultures.
- Eid practices:
  - Perform the Eid prayer in congregation if possible; listen to local rulings on timing and location.
  - Give Zakat al-Fitr before the Eid prayer so the needy may celebrate (consult local scholars on the amount).
  - Visit family, share food, and continue dua and gratitude.
- For practical fiqh on Eid prayers and congregational etiquette, consult local scholarly instructions.
- If you are traveling or in doubt about the end of Ramadan, consult your local mufti or authoritative religious body for the final ruling.
- For a comprehensive guide to Eid celebrations, dates, and traditions, read our [complete guide to Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha](https://www.deenup.app/blog/complete-guide-eid-celebrations).

## Practical tips to strengthen Ramadan: daily habits and community

- Keep goals simple and measurable: number of pages of Quran per day, number of sincere duas, one act of charity weekly.
- Use community help: coordinate with your mosque for volunteer iftar services and outreach.
- Technology use: set reminders for suhoor and iftar, use audio Quran or brief lectures to stay consistent without fatigue.
- Balance: if you work or study, prioritize sleep and split Quran reading into short sessions across the day.
- For study resources and structured courses, consult trusted Islamic educational platforms and institutes that offer Ramadan-specific programs and lessons.

External resources:

- For hadith collections and specific narrations around fasting and Ramadan practice, see [Sunnah Hadith references](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1905).
- For additional fiqh reading on Ramadan rulings and the end of Ramadan holiday decisions, check local scholarly sources for applicable rulings.

## How to answer "what day of Ramadan is it today" quickly

- Use trusted online Ramadan calendars tied to your city — these update daily and show the current day count.
- If you follow a local mosque, they will often display “Day N of Ramadan” on social channels each day.
- Keep a simple personal Ramadan calendar (paper or app) to mark completed fasts and special nights like the last ten.

## Common questions about moon-sighting, fasting, and Eid timing

- If a reliable local sighting is reported, follow the local Islamic authority or your community’s accepted method.
- If you wake uncertain whether the new moon was sighted, follow community guidance and consult a scholar; do not decide based solely on individual social media posts.
- If you are away from family and cannot attend Eid prayer in the mosque, follow local rulings about praying at home versus traveling for the congregation.

## Conclusion

Ramadan 2026 will follow the same principles as every Ramadan: sighting the moon determines the start and end, fasting is obligatory for those eligible, and the last ten nights offer a focused chance for deep spiritual renewal. Prepare practically by confirming local fasting times, set realistic Quran and dua goals, and plan for the last ten nights with intentional acts of worship. When in doubt about rulings—moon sighting, missed fasts, or Zakat al-Fitr—consult a qualified scholar or your local religious authority. May this Ramadan bring sincere repentance, strengthened connection to the Quran, and lasting good habits for you and your community.
