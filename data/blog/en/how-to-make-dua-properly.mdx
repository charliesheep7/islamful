## Core Etiquettes of Dua (What to do before you ask)

### Begin with praise and salawat
Praise Allah first: use short phrases like "Alhamdulillah" and send salawāt on the Prophet ﷺ. This follows the Prophetic method of starting with praise before asking and prepares the heart.

- Example opening: "Alhamdulillahi Rabbil 'alamin, Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad."
- The command to call on Allah and the emphasis on humility are found in the Quran (see quran.com/2/186 and quran.com/7/55).

### Be sincere and humble
Speak to Allah from real need. Avoid asking with arrogance or entitlement. Humility increases the value of the supplication; this tone is reflected across Prophetic supplications and Quranic guidance.

### Face the Qibla and choose modest posture
If possible, face the Qibla, lower your voice, and adopt a humble posture—standing, sitting, or sujood. The Prophet ﷺ preferred raising the hands in dua and used sujood as a moment of closeness with Allah.

> Common Mistake
> Making dua mechanically without addressing the heart weakens its effect. Slow down, remove distractions, and speak as if you expect a reply.

## How to Start a Dua: Words and Structure

### Start with praise, then salawat
Always open with praising Allah (hamd) and sending salawāt on the Prophet ﷺ. This is both Quranic and Prophetic etiquette and prepares your heart for asking.

### State your need clearly and briefly
Ask plainly. Say what you want in one or two sentences before elaborating. Concise requests are easier to focus on and to repeat.

- See SeekersGuidance for practical answers and guidance: SeekersGuidance article on worship (https://seekersguidance.org/).

### Balance between dunya and deen
Ask for guidance, faith, and forgiveness first; then ask for worldly needs. The Prophet ﷺ recommended prioritizing matters of faith when supplicating.

## Specific Phrases and Example Du'as

### Short openings you can use now
- "Alhamdulillahi Rabbil 'alamin."
- "Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad."
- "Subhana Rabbiyal A'la" (in sujood)

These openings are appropriate for many situations and help you begin.

### Prophetic du'as to memorize
Memorize short authentic supplications for common needs: seeking forgiveness, recovery from illness, and guidance. Verify texts from trusted hadith sources before using them.

Tip: Keep 3–4 favorite du'as on your phone and recite them when distracted or stressed.

### Making dua for others
State the person's name, ask for good in both worlds, and avoid requesting harm or coercion. Example: "O Allah, grant [Name] health, guidance, and steadfastness."

## Practical Steps: How to Perform Dua (Step-by-step)

### Step 1 — Prepare your heart and space
Remove distractions, take a few breaths, and set your intention (niyyah). Quiet surroundings help concentration more than the length of words.

### Step 2 — Use proper openings and make your request
Praise Allah, send salawat, then ask clearly. Raise your hands if you can. If in sujood, speak softly and humbly.

### Step 3 — Close and show gratitude
End by thanking Allah and saying "Ameen." Maintain patience; dua may be answered in different ways and times.

Common Mistake
Expecting immediate visible results and abandoning dua quickly. Persistence is part of prophetic practice; continue while using lawful means.

## Best Times and Conditions to Make Dua

### Times with increased recommended acceptance
- The last third of the night — a time emphasized in hadith for sincere supplication.
- After obligatory prayers, especially after Fajr and Maghrib.
- While in sujood and in the time between adhan and iqamah.

### Situations with strong emphasis for dua
- During hardship, illness, and after sincere repentance.
- On Fridays, during Ramadan, and while traveling — times emphasized across the scholarly tradition.

- For rulings and context about time-based worship and etiquette, consult established fatwa resources such as Dar al‑Ifta: Dar al‑Ifta’s related rulings (https://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=2603).

### Conditions to enhance focus
Avoid heavy meals or screens right before a dua; choose a short time when your mind is alert, even if it’s only two minutes.

## Building a Daily Dua Habit (4‑Week Build)

### Week 1: Create a simple routine
Focus: Build a 5‑minute daily dua slot.
Key Actions:
- Set a daily alarm for a quiet time.

Focus: Track what you ask and signs of acceptance.
Key Actions:
- Keep a short dua journal.
- Note any lawful actions you take toward your request.
- Review and refine your wording.
Mindset: Record keeping turns vague longing into concrete practice.

### Week 3: Increase sincerity and variety
Focus: Introduce prophetic du'as and private reflection.
Key Actions:
- Learn two authentic du'as from hadith collections.
- Spend one session in sujood.
- Add one minute of silent listening.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake: Mechanical repetition without heart
Avoid counting words or mindlessly reciting. Pause between lines and mean what you say.

### Mistake: Prioritizing dunya over deen
Start with guidance, faith, and forgiveness. Material needs are second and often better achieved when the root is addressed.

### Mistake: Ignoring complementary action
Dua must be paired with lawful effort. Make a plan for action that aligns with your request.

Tip:
If you're stuck, ask: "What one practical step can I do today toward this dua?" Then do it.
