faqs:
  - question: "How can I learn the correct words to greet another Muslim?"
    answer: "Learn the core formula “As-salamu ʿalaykum” and its response “Wa ʿalaykum as-salam.” Practice saying them in everyday situations, and refer to scholars or reliable texts if you want deeper fiqh details; consult a qualified scholar for specific rulings."
  - question: "When should I say Salam to someone I pass on the street?"
    answer: "You should initiate salam whenever you meet a fellow Muslim if practical and safe; the Prophet ﷺ encouraged spreading peace. If passing many people in a public space, follow local norms and safety while prioritizing sincere greeting."
  - question: "Is it better to say a longer greeting than just Salam?"
    answer: "You can add blessings like “As-salamu ʿalaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh” to increase reward and warmth. The shorter form is perfectly valid; extend the greeting when you know the situation allows or deserves more etiquette."
  - question: "What do I do if someone greets me in a different language?"
    answer: "Respond with the meaning of salam if you understand it, or reply with the Arabic form to ensure the correct Islamic greeting. The Qur'an instructs returning a greeting with one better or equal (Qur'an 4:86)."
  - question: "Can I say Salam over the phone or online?"
    answer: "Yes. Saying salam by phone, text, or social media is permitted and recommended to spread peace; ensure sincerity and avoid insincere or trivial uses. For formal questions about digital etiquette, consult community practice or a qualified scholar."
  - question: "Is it required to stand when an elder gives Salam?"
    answer: "Standing is a sign of respect in many cultures and can be done when an elder greets you; Islamic law does not mandate standing specifically for salam, but honoring elders is emphasized in the Sunnah. When unsure, follow respectful cultural norms and consult a scholar for local practice."

## The Core Formula and Immediate Responses

### The exact phrases to use
Use the Prophet’s ﷺ words: “As-salamu ʿalaykum” (Peace be upon you). For more blessing, say: “As-salamu ʿalaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.” The reply is “Wa ʿalaykum as-salam” or the fuller reply with mercy and blessings.

- [The Qur'an instructs returning greetings with equal or better words](https://quran.com/4/86).
- When addressing a group say “As-salamu ʿalaykum” or “As-salamu ʿalaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.”

### Responses across scenarios
If someone says only “Salam,” reply with the full phrase when possible; returning a greeting with something better fulfills the Qur'anic instruction. Over phone or text, reply promptly and sincerely.

### Non-Arabic greetings and their place
Greeting in another language is permissible; the Arabic salam preserves the prophetic wording and the dua-like reward. If you wish to maintain the Islamic phrase, you can say both: the local greeting followed by “As-salamu ʿalaykum.”

**Common mistake:** Avoid treating salam as a mere social habit; neglecting sincerity reduces the spiritual benefit. Offer it intentionally.

## Who to Greet and When to Initiate Salam

### People you should proactively greet
Initiate salam with fellow Muslims you meet, including family, neighbors, students, colleagues, and visitors. The Prophet ﷺ encouraged spreading peace as part of community building.

### Situations where you should be cautious
If safety, privacy, or personal circumstances make initiating salam unwise, prioritize safety while maintaining respectful behavior. In crowded or formal settings, follow local etiquette but do not refuse a sincere salam out of disdain.

### Greeting elders, scholars, and strangers
Show extra respect to elders and teachers—stand if culturally appropriate and practical. When in doubt, a respectful posture plus the verbal salam is sufficient; consult local scholarly guidance for specific protocols.

## Verbal Variations and Their Meanings

### Short vs. long forms
Short form: “As-salamu ʿalaykum.” Long form: add “wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.” The longer form expands the prayer aspect, asking Allah for mercy and blessings for the addressee.

### When to use blessings or duas
Use extended salam with someone you respect, when reuniting, or when you want to make the greeting more heartfelt. In quick encounters, the short form is acceptable and valid.

### Gender considerations and privacy
Salam is permitted between unrelated men and women in public with proper boundaries. Maintain modest interaction while fulfilling the sunnah of greeting. For personal rulings, consult a qualified scholar.

## Non-Verbal Etiquette and Body Language

### Eye contact, handshakes, and posture
Offer a warm smile, moderate eye contact, and a handshake if culturally appropriate and comfortable for both parties. If physical contact is not permissible, place your hand over your heart while saying salam to show sincerity.

### Entering homes, mosques, and gatherings
Say salam when entering a Muslim home or mosque; some etiquette includes pausing at the entrance, removing shoes where required, and greeting with respect. Returning the host's salam promptly is recommended.

### Digital greetings and group chats
Use salam in messages to promote Islamic brotherhood. When initiating a group chat, open with salam to set a respectful tone. Be mindful of tone and avoid trivializing sacred phrases.

## Common Questions and Practical Tips

### Is repeating salam more rewarding?
Saying additional blessings is meritorious when sincere. Repeating unnecessarily or in a disruptive way is not recommended. Balance sincerity with practicality.

### Returning salam when someone mispronounces it
Respond taking the benefit: supply the correct greeting gently, or simply reply with the full prophetic formula to complete the etiquette.

### When a non-Muslim greets you
Respond kindly and with respect; returning a polite greeting is acceptable and fosters good relations. You may respond with the meaning or the Arabic salam.

Tip: When uncertain, respond with “Wa ʿalaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh” once; this covers correct etiquette across most situations.

### When fiqh matters influence greetings
Questions like whether to stand or offer multiple salutations can depend on local custom and madhhab. When you need specific rulings, consult a qualified local scholar.
