**Islamful is a free, all-in-one Islamic tools platform** built for every Muslim — whether you are checking prayer times before Fajr, verifying whether an ingredient is halal, or looking for reliable Islamic knowledge online.

Every tool is free, works in English and Arabic, and is designed to be fast and accurate — no login required.

## What Tools Does Islamful Offer?

Islamful has seven tools, all free and available today:

### 1. Prayer Times

The [Prayer Times tool](/prayer-times) gives you accurate, location-based salah times for all five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.

- **Automatic location detection** — grant location permission and times load instantly
- **Manual city search** — type any city worldwide for accurate results
- **Multiple calculation methods** — ISNA, Muslim World League, Egyptian, and more, so you can match your local practice
- **Powered by the Aladhan API**, one of the most trusted Islamic calculation engines

### 2. AI Halal Checker

The [Halal Checker](/haram-check) lets you ask whether any food, ingredient, or practice is halal or haram — and get a clear, Islamically-grounded answer in seconds.

It works in two steps:

1. **Instant static database** — 23+ common items (gelatin, alcohol, pork derivatives, etc.) return results immediately with no loading time
2. **AI fallback via Gemini** — for anything not in the static database, the query goes to Google's Gemini AI through a secure backend, which returns a ruling with Quranic and scholarly references

The checker is designed to be honest: it clearly states when a ruling is debated among scholars rather than giving false certainty.

## Why Was Islamful Built?

Muslims searching for basic Islamic information online face a fragmented experience: prayer time apps on one platform, halal checkers on another, Quran on a third — and much of it is covered in ads, paywalls, or outdated design.

Islamful was built around one principle: **every Muslim deserves a single, free, trustworthy place for the tools they use daily.**

The platform is built with speed and privacy in mind:

- **No ads** disrupting worship or research
- **No data sold** — analytics are handled by Umami, a privacy-focused, cookie-free analytics tool
- **Available in English and Arabic** with proper RTL support

## Who Is Islamful For?

Islamful is built for:

- **Practicing Muslims** who want quick, reliable prayer times and halal rulings without navigating cluttered apps
- **New Muslims** who are still learning what is permissible and want clear, referenced answers
- **Muslim families** who want a single resource to check food ingredients before shopping
- **Arabic-speaking users** who need Islamic tools in their language with proper RTL layout

## Is Islamful Trustworthy?

Islamful does not claim religious authority — it is a tool platform, not a fatwa service. Here is how it maintains accuracy and trust:

- **Prayer times** use the Aladhan API with established astronomical calculation methods
- **Halal rulings** cite Quranic verses, authentic hadith, and scholarly consensus where applicable
- **AI responses** are prefaced with appropriate caveats and encourage consulting a local scholar for complex personal matters
- **The blog** cites sources for all claims and is updated regularly

For complex fiqh questions, Islamful always recommends consulting a qualified Islamic scholar.

## Our Hope for the Muslim Community

Islam has always encouraged the pursuit of knowledge. The Prophet ﷺ said: _"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim."_ (Ibn Majah)

Technology is a tool — and like any tool, its value lies in how it is used. Our hope in building Islamful is simple: that Muslims everywhere find it easier to remember Allah, to live according to His guidance, and to access Islamic knowledge without unnecessary barriers.

> _"Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees."_
> — Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:11

We pray that these tools serve as a means of drawing closer to Allah — and that every prayer time checked, every dua remembered, and every halal question answered is counted as a good deed. Insha'Allah.
