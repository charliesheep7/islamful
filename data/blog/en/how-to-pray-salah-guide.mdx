faqs:
  - question: "How can I learn the basic steps of salah if I'm a new revert?"
    answer: "Start with the five pillars: intention, standing, bowing, prostration, and sitting. Learn the short Arabic recitations (e.g., Al-Fatihah) and practice movements slowly. Consult a local teacher or use trusted guides and verify with scholars if unsure."
  - question: "When should I make wudu if I'm unsure about my state of purity?"
    answer: "Perform wudu before prayer when you know a nullifying act occurred (e.g., toilet use). If you're unsure, follow the presumption of continuity and perform wudu to be certain; ask a qualified scholar for complex cases."
  - question: "What should I say if I forget a recitation during salah?"
    answer: "Resume the prayer calmly and continue; do not repeat past actions. If the omission changes the prayer's validity, perform the prostration of forgetfulness (sujood al-sahw) at the end and consult scholarly guidance."
  - question: "Can I combine prayers when I travel and how?"
    answer: "Travelers may combine Dhuhr with Asr and Maghrib with Isha in some schools; check your madhhab and circumstances. Consult a qualified scholar or reliable school-specific guidance for precise rulings."
  - question: "Is it acceptable to read the translation of the Quran during salah?"
    answer: "Reciting the Arabic of Quranic verses and supplications is required in salah; translations are for understanding but do not replace Arabic recitation. Learn meanings outside prayer to deepen focus in salah."
  - question: "How can I improve khushu (focus) during prayer?"
    answer: "Prepare mentally before prayer: make a sincere intention and clear distractions. Short practical steps: perform wudu deliberately, choose a quiet place, understand what you recite, and reflect on the meanings during each position."

## Watch a clear demonstration of every movement and recitation

Below are reliable ways to view a clear, practical demonstration of the postures and recitations:

- Search YouTube for "How to pray Salah step by step" and select a lesson by a trusted teacher or institution (look for videos produced by reputable Islamic centers, scholars, or community organizations).
- Use the hadith and fiqh references cited below to verify precise actions and words.

For textual guidance and authenticated prophetic practice, refer to the hadith collections and scholarly articles linked elsewhere in this guide.

## Preparing for Prayer: Intention, Purity, and Place

### Make and understand your intention (niyyah)
State in your heart which prayer you will perform (e.g., Dhuhr, four rak'ahs). You do not need to say it aloud; a firm inner intention suffices. Intention aligns your action with worship.

### Perform wudu step-by-step
Wash hands, rinse mouth and nose, wash the face, wash arms to the elbows, wipe the head, wipe the ears, and wash the feet up to the ankles in that order. Follow the sunnah sequence and perform each action deliberately. For a reliable procedural source, see the relevant hadith on wudu ([Sahih collection example](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:176)).

Common mistake: Washing too quickly or skipping parts can invalidate wudu in some cases. Perform each step deliberately and consult a scholar for complex situations.

### Choose a clean, quiet place and dress appropriately
Face the qibla, remove obstacles, and wear clothing that covers the required parts (awrah). A simple prayer mat or a clean floor is sufficient.

## Step-by-Step: The Actions and Words in One Rak'ah

### Opening and Takbiratul Ihram
Raise your hands to the ears or shoulders and say "Allahu Akbar." This marks the start of the prayer; after it, ordinary speech and unnecessary movement are prohibited.

### Standing and reciting Surah Al-Fatihah
While standing, recite quietly or aloud depending on the prayer. Surah Al-Fatihah is required in every rak'ah. Learn its meaning to connect with the words; translation helps understanding, but the recitation in prayer is in Arabic (see guidance [Quran 2:43](https://quran.com/2/43)).

### Recite a short surah or verses after Al-Fatihah
Recite a brief surah such as Al-Ikhlās or Al-Falaq or short verses from the Quran. This completes the standing portion of the rak'ah.

## Flow of Movements: Ruku, Standing, Sujood, and Sitting

### Ruku (bowing) with dhikr
Bend at the waist, keep the back straight, place hands on the knees, and say "Subḥāna Rabbiyal-ʿAẓīm" at least three times. Rise saying "Sami'Allahu liman ḥamidah" and then "Rabbana lakal ḥamd."

### Sujood (prostration) and its words
Place your forehead and nose, palms, knees, and toes on the ground; say "Subḥāna Rabbiyal-Aʿlā" at least three times. Prostration is the moment of closest humility to Allah — take your time where possible.

### Jalsa (sitting) between sujood and the final sitting
Sit with the left foot under you and the right foot upright; briefly pause, then perform the second sujood. In the final sitting, recite the Tashahhud and send salutations on the Prophet ﷺ.

Tip: Learn short Arabic phrases with their translations and practice them quietly until they become natural in prayer.

## Completing the Prayer: Tashahhud, Salawat, and Taslim

### Tashahhud and Salawat
In the final sitting, recite the full Tashahhud, then send blessings on the Prophet ﷺ (Salawat). These words are essential parts of the final sitting.

### Personal supplication (du'a) after Tashahhud
Make personal du'a after the Salawat but before Taslim; it's a recommended time to ask sincerely.

### Ending with Taslim
Turn your head to the right saying "Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah" and then to the left repeating the same. This completes the prayer.

## Variations by Prayer Type and When to Recite Aloud

### Prayers performed aloud vs silently
Fajr and the first two rak'ahs of Maghrib and Isha are recited aloud in congregational settings; Dhuhr and Asr are typically recited silently. Learn the convention for each prayer and follow your local imam or school.

### Number of rak'ahs for each prayer
Fajr: 2; Dhuhr: 4; Asr: 4; Maghrib: 3; Isha: 4. Include Sunnah and Nafl separately when counting voluntary prayers.

### Shortening and combining on travel
When traveling, many schools permit shortening (qasr) and some conditions allow combining (jamʿ) prayers. Check your madhhab and consult a qualified scholar for personal circumstances and accepted conditions (see practical rulings from recognized scholarly resources, for example according to Islamic scholars: https://seekersguidance.org/).

## Common Questions About Validity and Corrections

### Missed recitation or mistaken rak'ah count
If you realize a mistake before finishing, correct it immediately. If discovered after finishing, perform sujood al-sahw (prostration of forgetfulness) at the end as required.

### Touching impurities, bleeding, or minor issues
Minor bleeding does not always nullify wudu; rulings differ by madhhab. Consult a qualified scholar for specific cases — for general scholarly notes see reputable institutions such as Yaqeen Institute (https://yaqeeninstitute.org/) and Dar al-Ifta (https://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=1234).

Common mistake: Assuming one action nullifies prayer without checking reliable sources. For complex or personal rulings, consult a qualified scholar.

## Practice Tools, Checklists, and Micro-Habits to Build Consistency

### Simple daily checklist before each prayer
- [ ] Intend the correct prayer (niyyah)
- [ ] Perform complete wudu
- [ ] Face the qibla and remove distractions
- [ ] Recite Al-Fatihah and a short surah per rak'ah
- [ ] Complete Tashahhud and Taslim

### Micro-actions to improve khushu
Practice short reflective pauses between positions. Memorize the translation of Al-Fatihah and your chosen short surahs. Use a quiet corner at home consistently for prayer times.

Tip: Schedule one extra minute of silent reflection after each prayer to build focus slowly.

## Troubleshooting: Frequently Made Errors and Quick Fixes

### Common recitation errors
If you skip a required part like Al-Fatihah in a unit and catch it immediately, correct it; if unsure after finishing, perform sujood al-sahw as appropriate.

### Physical limitations and alternatives
If you cannot stand, pray sitting; if you cannot sit, pray lying down. The religion makes allowances for the ill or injured — consult local scholarly guidance for specifics.

## Scripture and Hadith to Anchor Practice

"Establish prayer and give zakah" is the practical command to a life of worship and social responsibility; keep the Quran and Hadith as the primary reference for rules and spirit of prayer. For specific prophetic practice details see relevant hadith collections (for example, sahih hadith references on postures and wudu: https://sunnah.com/bukhari:10 and https://sunnah.com/bukhari:176).

Use trusted scholarly sources for rulings, seek local guidance for difficult questions, and focus on meaning as much as form. Small, consistent actions — a short du'a after each prayer, steady memorization of short surahs, and deliberate wudu — transform mechanical motions into sincere worship. Start today, repeat daily, and let prayer reshape your moments into mindful, faith-filled encounters.
