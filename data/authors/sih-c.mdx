Sih leads Deen Back's AI direction, helping Muslims use technology to deepen their relationship with the
Qur'an and Sunnah. After completing the McKinsey & Company Academy credential in applied analytics,
Sih focused on translating those methods into ethical, privacy-first tooling for Islamic study.

They now oversee Deen Back's product vision, from knowledge-grounded chat experiences to the habit loops
that keep seekers consistent. Sih's priority is ensuring every feature honors Islamic principles while
making it easier for busy Muslims to keep up with their learning goals.
