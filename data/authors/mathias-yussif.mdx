Mathias Yussif curates DeenUp's Islamic practice guidance with the same diligence he applies to
shaping faith-forward programming at Eyon TV. He studied classical tafsir and fiqh throughout his
childhood in Tamale before continuing his Islamic education at the Anbariyya Institute. Those years
gave him a deep respect for scholarship, isnad-driven authenticity, and the responsibility that comes
with teaching Muslims online.

At DeenUp, Mathias translates scholarly rigor into approachable lessons for seekers around the world.
He pairs references from the Qur'an and Hadith with practical routines that modern professionals can
apply immediately. His goal is simple: make it effortless for every Muslim to act upon what they
learn, one guided habit at a time.
