    "subtitle": "Nearly every AI today is built by a handful of companies, with little regard for the ummah or the spiritual needs of the Muslim community. At Deen Back, we're building an alternative: AI that starts from the Quran, honors authentic scholarship, and serves believers everywhere. We don't use AI to interpret the Quran. Instead, the Quran shapes our AI—and every answer is cited from trusted scholars, not generated by algorithms.",

        "question": "How can I trust the Islamic accuracy of Deen Back's guidance?",
        "answer": "Deen Back does not rely on AI to generate Islamic rulings. Instead, we use AI as a powerful search tool to help you find authentic guidance directly from the Holy Quran and authentic Hadith. Every answer includes proper citations and references to original sources, allowing you to verify the information yourself. Our AI helps you access the wisdom of the Quran more efficiently, but the guidance comes from Allah's words, not artificial intelligence."

      {
        "question": "Is Deen Back suitable for new Muslims and reverts?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Deen Back is designed for Muslims at all stages of their faith journey. New Muslims and reverts particularly benefit from our 24/7 AI companion that can answer questions anytime, without judgment. The Daily Good Deen checklist helps establish foundational habits, and the community letter feature connects you with supportive brothers and sisters worldwide."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the anonymous letter feature work?",
        "answer": "The letter feature allows you to write and receive anonymous messages to help Muslim brothers and sisters globally. You can share encouragement, ask for advice, or offer support—all while maintaining privacy. This feature is inspired by Quran 4:114, encouraging charity, goodness, and making peace between people. Every letter is moderated to ensure it aligns with Islamic values."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the Daily Good Deen checklist?",
        "answer": "Yes! While Deen Back provides a default checklist based on essential Islamic practices, you can customize it to match your personal spiritual goals and daily routine. Track prayers, Quran reading, dhikr, charity, and other acts of worship that are meaningful to your faith journey."
      },
      {
        "question": "What languages does Deen Back support?",
        "answer": "Deen Back currently supports English and Arabic, with the interface automatically switching to right-to-left (RTL) layout for Arabic. We chose these languages to serve both English-speaking Muslims globally and Arabic-speaking Muslims in the Middle East and North Africa. More languages may be added based on community needs."
